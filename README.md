# BigInt Implementation

This project provides an implementation of a `BigInt` class in C++ for handling arbitrarily large integers. It includes various constructors, arithmetic operations, comparison operators, and utility functions like factorial, Fibonacci, and Catalan number calculations.

## Features

- **Constructors**:
  - Create a `BigInt` from an integer, string, or another `BigInt`.
- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`).
- **Comparison Operators**:
  - Equality (`==`), Inequality (`!=`), Greater/Less Than (`>`, `<`), etc.
- **Utility Functions**:
  - Factorial of a number.
  - Nth Fibonacci number.
  - Nth Catalan number.
